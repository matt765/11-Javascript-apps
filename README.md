# 11-javascript-apps

This is my Javascript project with 11 fairly simple apps using external APIs, JS libraries and DOM manipulation. I gathered different ideas from across the internet and coded them into one website with accordion UI. 

You can see it live here https://matt765.github.io/11-javascript-apps/

Planned updates:
- refactoring HTML classes using proper naming convention
- migration from vanilla JS to React and from CSS to SASS
